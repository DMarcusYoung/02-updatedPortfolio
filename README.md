# week2hw# Marcus Young Portfolio Website

## Summary

This website is a redone version of my original portolio page. The main change was the use of the bootstrap framework to load pre done css for formatting and design. The actual content is pretty much the same with the addition of a sticky footer on all 3 pages.

### Differences
I used a lot less css this time because a simple class in html would load in a ton of css. However as a result, there was a bit more html but it was still pretty straightforward. The grid method that comes with bootstrap was soooo helpful. Not only was it *way* easier to format everything, but also it accounts for multiple screen sizes.

## Challenges
While bootstap made things much easier, there still was some minor challenges. I did have to constantly check the documentation to find what I wanted and I spent a lot of time looking for stuff that didn't exist in the bootstrap framework.

## Feedback
If there are any suggestions for my website or ideas for future projects to include in my portfolio, let me know in the contact me page.

## Disclaimer
Once again, please be warned if for some reason you have something against the color green. I added a slightly obnoxious background that flaunts the fact that green is my favorite color, but it's my portfolio page so be aware of that and deal with it. Thanks!
